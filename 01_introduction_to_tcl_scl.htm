    <h1>Module 1: Introduction to Tcl and SCL</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the world of Surpac scripting! This first module will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of the Tcl language and the Surpac Command Language (SCL) extensions that allow you to automate your work.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1.1 What is Tcl?</h2>
    <p>
        Tcl, which stands for "Tool Command Language", is the scripting language that Surpac uses under the hood. You don't need to be a software developer to use it. Think of it as a set of simple, English-like commands that you can write in a text file to make Surpac perform a sequence of tasks automatically.
    </p>
    <p>The most important concept in Tcl is that <strong>everything is a command, and everything can be treated as a string (text)</strong>. This makes the language syntax very simple and consistent.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1.2 What is SCL?</h2>
    <p>
        If Tcl is the language, then the <strong>Surpac Command Language (SCL)</strong> is the specialized vocabulary for that language. SCL is a library of custom commands that GEOVIA has created specifically to give you control over Surpac's functions and data from a Tcl script.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can think of it like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tcl:</strong> Provides the basic grammar and structure (loops, variables, logic).</li>
        <li><strong>SCL:</strong> Provides the powerful "action words" to interact with Surpac objects like string files, DTMs, block models, and the graphics viewport.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most SCL commands begin with the prefix <code>Scl</code> (e.g., <code>SclSwaOpenFile</code>) or <code>Guido</code> for creating user interfaces.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1.3 Your First Script: "Hello, Surpac!"</h2>
    <p>
        The best way to learn is by doing. Let's write a simple script that displays a message in the Surpac message window. This is a fundamental way to give feedback to the user of your script.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 1: Create the Script File</h3>
    <p>
        Open a plain text editor (like Notepad, Notepad++, or VS Code) and type the following command into a new file:
    </p>
    <pre><code># My first Surpac script
# This line is a comment and will be ignored by the computer.

SclMessage "INFO" "Hello, Surpac! The script is running."</code></pre>

    <h3>Step 2: Save the File</h3>
    <p>
        Save the file in your current working directory with the name <code>hello_surpac.tcl</code>. The <code>.tcl</code> extension is important as it tells Surpac that this is a Tcl script file.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3: Run the Script in Surpac</h3>
    <p>
        Inside Surpac, find the menu option for running a script (often under a "Macros" or "Automation" menu) and select the <code>hello_surpac.tcl</code> file you just saved.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4: See the Result</h3>
    <p>
        After running the script, you should see the following message appear in your Surpac message window:
    </p>
    <div class="note">
        <strong>Hello, Surpac! The script is running.</strong>
    </div>

    <h3>Code Breakdown:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>#</code>: The hash symbol indicates a comment. Surpac ignores these lines. They are for you to leave notes for yourself and others.</li>
        <li>
            <code>SclMessage</code>: This is the SCL command used to show a message. For more details, you can view its official documentation here: 
            <a href="../../scl/message.htm" target="_blank">SclMessage Documentation</a>.
        </li>
        <li><code>"INFO"</code>: This is the first argument to the command. It tells Surpac what type of message it is (other options might include "ERROR" or "WARNING").</li>
        <li><code>"Hello, Surpac! ..."</code>: This is the second argument, which is the actual text you want to display.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Congratulations!</strong> You have successfully written and executed your first SCL script. In the next module, we will dive deeper into the Tcl language fundamentals that form the building blocks of more complex and powerful scripts.
